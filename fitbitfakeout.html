              <h2>FITBIT FAKE OUT</h2>
<p>Fitbit is one of the largest fitness trackers in the Industry. Many people use Fitbits for their own personal use, but some use them for financial incentives in their workplace. These financial incentives, whether it is a deduction of your healthcare cost or a cash prizes, encourage cheating your Fitbit.</p>

<p>Our goal as a group was to change the mental models of users and limit the amount of cheating on these fitness trackers. To redesign a new way to track fitness which not only discourages users to cheat but also make them want to not cheat altogether.</p>

              <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p>SECONDARY
Sneha and I started off doing research, we researched different ways users cheat, different reasons for cheating, and how these companies like Fitbit try to combat these methods of cheating.

We researched different companies similar to Fitbit, their user interface, their wearables, and how they track data. We found that users cheat because it’s easy and it provides the opportunity to earn their goal to get that financial goal in their workplace or they like the rush of dopamine from reaching a goal so much they resort to cheating to receive it.</p>

<p>PRIMARY
We also conducted 2 interviews, through these interviews we found a different way users can “cheat” their Fitbit. One interviewee stated that at least 4 hours a day he wasn’t able to track his data, this lead to 4 hours of activity not being tracked which flawed his data the next time he checked his application.</p>

<h2>USABILITY TEST</h2>
<p>When we conducted our test we tested 3 users, Each user could seamlessly travel from one page to the next and had very minimal questions when testing the interface.

One thing we did observe when testing was that users focused on the reward section of the application. They spent minimal time checking the social aspect of the application.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
<p>Sneha and I designed two solutions we thought fit the criteria and solved the problem. Sneha worked on the final prototype of the interface and I worked on designing a new wearable that could more accurately track your fitness and other related items.</p>

<h2>WEARABLE</h2>
<p>When designing the wearable I primarily wanted to fix the problem people have when they do certain activities their Fitbit would completely miss these events.

I wanted to design something small and comfortable that fit around someone’s ankle and allowed them to track strides, heart rate, and other fitness related data. This way if someone is required to remove watches for work or if you do an activity in which your arms remain stationary the wearable would still be able to track every movement you make for an accurate reading.</p>

<h2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>When working with Sneha, I realized we spent very little time collaborating and more time working individually on separate parts and then brought them together at the end. One thing I plan to improve on in the future is to collaborate way more than I did on this first project. I now realize that it takes collaboration throughout the entire process in order to have a strong final solution. A strong team is a key to a strong project.
