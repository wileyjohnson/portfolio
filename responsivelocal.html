              <p>Lyft is one of the fastest growing companies in the “sharing” or gig economy, more than doubling their number of rides in 2017 to over 375 million. Consider that one of the world’s largest transportation companies owns no fleet of vehicles, and employs less than 2000 people, despite the fact they facilitate over 30 million rides a month in hundreds of US cities, covering over 95% of the US population. One of the most important mechanisms that enable the gig economy is qualified and accurate ratings from users, which allow operators to divert resources appropriately and reward contractors that provide high levels of customer service. The current rating system tacitly encourages users to only rank their driver using very good or very bad rankings, due to the known limitations of a five-star scale.</p>

              <p>Our goal was to create a replacement for the current five-star rating and review system that Lyft uses to track and reward drivers in their system. We had to consider the ways various rating and review systems constrain the input of users, the ease of use (e.g., speed of input in a busy urban environment), and the ways in which this information could be used maliciously against drivers, while also building on the evolution of rating approaches in the gig economy at large.</p>


              <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p>SECONDARY
My team started off by just researching the current Lyft rating system and compared it to others such as Uber. We wanted to find what was missing from it and also wanted to find out what limited it as a whole. We also looked for Driver reviews of the Lyft experience, we found that the drivers dislike how ambiguous the rating system is and that the riders don’t understand it.</p>

<p>PRIMARY
My team conducted 3 interviews with various users to try to gauge what they thought about the rating system and also try to figure out how average user rates and why. These interviews lead neatly into our idea because we wanted to give users a definitive way to rate.</p>



<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
<p>
My team designed a solution to fit our criteria to improve how drivers are rated and also provide the necessary information to help them improve. We designed 3 sections, The Car, The Ride, & The Driver. These 3 sections gave users a set thing to rate which in turn allowed for the driver to know what they wanted to improve on. We felt this idea was the ideal solution because it didn’t rely on a binary rating scale, it instead focused on keywords, such as clean or dirty, friendly or unfriendly, etc. We believed this provided an easy description to allow the driver to know what needs work.</p>


<h2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>In the future, my team hoped to have refined our idea to make it more clean, easy to understand, and more usable to all users.
